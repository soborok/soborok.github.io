I haven't updated my blog. Yesterday, I decided to work on building my "static" blog. First thing is to get to know Jekyll. Thanks to Matthew, my decision was made quickly. 

I want to make my first NEW blog post with simple code which would show little bit of my stack. :)

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Jekyll')
#=> prints 'Hi, Jekyll' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_thanks(name)
  puts "Thanks, #{name}"
end
print_thanks('Matthew')
#=> prints 'Thanks, Matthew' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
