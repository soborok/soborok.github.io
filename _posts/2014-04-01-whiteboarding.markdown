A whiteboarding is held bi-weekly by a friend. It was second session and today's challenge was writing a class of stack and queue. I have done this one before so it wasn't difficult to start. But there was one different condition for queue class. We had to use 2 stacks in Queue class.  

Queue is First In First Out and stack is Last In First Out. When dequeueing, it has to move all values to another stack temporarily, dequeues a last value and move all values back to the original stack.  

In Stack class we used an array to store data. After the whiteboarding session I did whiteboard to create a Stack class using node objects with Matthew. It was more brain picking and reminded me of data structure class back in college.  

I found out it is a good practice to list methods in the corner. It keeps tracks as well as helps to visualize. Another good habit is to clarify the problem. I didn't get the purpose of 2 stacks in Queue class and had to ask what the 2nd stack instance does. Later I found out another team member was misusing the 2nd stack. Need to make sure what the problem is and communicate with interviewer.
