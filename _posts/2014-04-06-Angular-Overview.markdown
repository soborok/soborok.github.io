Today I went to Chicago Women Developers meetup at Rightpoint. JavaScript frameworks have been on my to do list and finally I was able to attend one. A week ago I was late to register for Node.js meetup by one day.

Title of the meetup was "Angular Overview (cool people would call it an ng Overview)". It was my first time to Chicago Women Developers and Rightpoint. The place was nice and atmosphere was lively/active.

It was overview of AnguarlJS. I have used Backbone.js and I researched it from knowing nothing about it. The challenge was to feed tweeets to a webpage. It took me quite some time to get it working but I could see how MVP works and it was fun while researching. However, when someone gives an overview I can start from fundamental. And I prefer to have overview when learning a new thing. In this way I can have comprehensive understaning while learning and this gives me confidence.

Thanks to good presentation I picked up how AngularJS works quickly. They mentioned benefits of AngularJS which I will have to learn at work and they showed a example with code. It was really useful session. 

What interested me more is that the approach is different from Backbone. Today's example was listing github users and show a user info. It is similar to feed tweets on timeline. Backbone has separate js files and appends tweets to DOM. AngularJS uses ng tag in HTML tags and attaches data to DOM. I didn't write sample code so my understanding may not be accurate. I will come back and compare these two of listing.
