			<h3>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h3>
		  	<p class="date">October 12, 2014</p>
		  	<h5>I can do it at Kitchen, I can complaint at Restaurants. </h5> 
		  	<p>Personally the most inspiring thing in the video was "I can do it" mind. <br />
		  	Kitchen mind and restaurants mind is interesting. Kitchen mind was what I have been informed before I started this cohort. But the most important thing I should have in mind will be "I can do it". <br /><br />
		  	I studying CE and pursued my career in non-development in IT industry. I needed to have programming skill and I wanted to have that skill. But I was not able to make it happen. There are few reason. I found programming fun but more overwelming when I was in college. I was too busy and moving around to create opportunity. <br /><br />
		  	But what I found was I didn't have the mind. After a long time , I am finally ready to commit myself in time and money wise. More importantly, my mind is ready. <br /><br />
		  	I approached Dev Bootcamp with the mind "I can do it". I took a detour to come here. But I am glad I got it now and found this chances. I expect to have a great result after I finish my cohort. But the mind I will have is kitchen mind. I will be cooking what I crave to have in kitchen. I won't be sitting, waiting and complaining what I get on my table. </p>
