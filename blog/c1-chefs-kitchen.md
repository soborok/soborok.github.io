I can do it at Kitchen, I can complaint at Restaurants. 

October 12, 2014

Personally the most inspiring thing in the video was "I can do it" mind. 

Kitchen mind and restaurants mind is interesting. Kitchen mind was what I have been informed before I started this cohort. But the most important thing I should have in mind will be "I can do it". 

I studying CE and pursued my career in non-development in IT industry. I needed to have programming skill and I wanted to have that skill. But I was not able to make it happen. There are few reason. I found programming fun but more overwelming when I was in college. I was too busy and moving around to create opportunity. 

But what I found was I didn't have the mind. After a long time , I am finally ready to commit myself in time and money wise. More importantly, my mind is ready. 

I approached Dev Bootcamp with the mind "I can do it". I took a detour to come here. But I am glad I got it now and found this chances. I expect to have a great result after I finish my cohort. But the mind I will have is kitchen mind. I will be cooking what I crave to have in kitchen. I won't be sitting, waiting and complaining what I get on my table.
