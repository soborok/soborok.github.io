			<h3>Thinking Styles</h3>
		  	<p class="date">
		  		October 25, 2014
		  	</p>
		  	<h5>Concrete or Abstract? Sequential or Random</h5> 
		  	<p>Taking a short thinking style test was interesting when I was preparing for DBC. Thinking Styles is Anthony Gregorc's work and it has 4 qualities which a person use more when they think and learn. <br />
		  	My thinking style is AS and CS. I'd like to have just one style but my test score was the same on AS and CS. I have very low score in CR and AR which has Random ability. I am convinced by Anthony Gregorc's work cause I am not a person who can randomly do many things at a time and get a good result. I have thought this style of me not allow me to have creativity and flexibility. However, I am very well orgarnized and quick leaner once I know the sequence. <br />
			</p> 
		  	<h5>DBC and CS + AS</h5> 
		  	<p>DBC is short-term intense programming course. There is a lot of paring/gourp projects and I need to do a lot of self-study. And I will be learning new programming language and new stuffs. In the first and second week of phase 0 I struggled with study order and resources. I started it late so I was busy catching up early assignments. I didn't get how curriculum is structured, what can be done first and how they are related. This difficulty I had is related to my thinking style. <br />
		  	When I am given some amount of info I take time, think them through, put them in an order and relate them. I need time to absorb and process inputs in me. I will be doing great once I get the flow and structure in my head. I am worried about phase 1 if I wouldn't have time for myself to orgarnize new learning and my thoughts. It would help me if I study beforehand and spend personal time to analyze/orgarnize learning.<br />
		  	Good thing is there will be experts in DBC campus. They give clear feedback and let me reach my goal. 
			</p> 
			<h5>Thinking Styles and Mindset</h5>
			<p>Before phase 0 started I read about growth vs. fixed mindset. This gave me a good view of my mindset. I agree on many points and I found I got used to fixed mindset. Good news is I can exercise and change my mindset. I focus on process rather than just result and opened my mind to cricticism. I won't get discouraged when I don't accomplish my challenge because my thinking style need consuming time. I will try challenge again, make it mine and take the process as a part of my output.
