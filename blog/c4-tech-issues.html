		  	<h5>Oracle and Google APIs fight</h5> 
		  	<p>I am studying to become a developer. Currently I am working on programming languages and later I will be working on SQL, framework, APIs and so on. Considering my current status, Google-Oracle APIs fight woudl be a difficult topic but I'd like to have a look.<br /><br />
			This is briefly said <br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Oracle has Java-related APIs and Google uses them in Android OS<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Oracle accuses that Google infringes on the APIs<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;California court ruled the APIs are not copyrightable<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal court concluded the APIs are copyrightable<br />
			<br />
			This issue is followed by some concerns; whether Google's API use is fair-use or not, API owners could monopoize using their API. <br />
			As a novice developer I like the idea being able to use existing APIs. On the other hand, I want to be recognized and rewarded for my work.<br />
			I chose this topic for blog assignment. I thought I would have my opinion after some research. But I was running into more ideas and technology and I cannot make my opinion.<br />
			I don't have a deep insight or experience like the computer scientists but I want to consider that the purpose of the APIs and who is benefitted by having them in Android. <br />
