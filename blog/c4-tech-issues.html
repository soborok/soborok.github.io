		  	<h5>Oracle and Google APIs fight</h5> 
		  	<p>I am studying to become a developer. Currently I am working on programming languages and later I will be working on SQL, framework, APIs and so on. Considering my current status, Google-Oracle APIs fight woudl be a difficult topic but I'd like to have a look.<br><br>
			This is briefly said <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Oracle has Java-related APIs and Google uses them in Android OS<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Oracle accuses that Google infringes on the APIs<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;California court ruled the APIs are not copyrightable<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal court concluded the APIs are copyrightable<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is sent back to district court to find whether Google's API use is fair-use or not<br><br>
			This issue is important because software and hardware implement APIs in their development. And some computer scientists are concerned that this ruling would increase technology cost and monopolize software compatibility.<br>
			As a novice developer I like to have freedom to implement APIs. I would be using APIs between software and software and having the APIs many developers are able to build their application. <br>
			On the other hand, I want to be recognized and rewarded for my code. Google and Sun Microsystems/Oracle have discussed about licensing before. I hope they can find level of contribution and reward for it.
			<br>
			I chose this topic for blog assignment. I thought I would have my opinion after some research. But I cannot pick a side. I want to consider that why the APIs exist and who is benefitted by having them in Android. <br>
