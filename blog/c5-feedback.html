			<h3>Paring and Feedback</h3>

		  	<h5>Learning from others and myself</h5> 
		  	<p>In DBC I am doing more pairings than ever. I pair remotely and sometimes being remote makes communication more difficult. It is hard to share my thoughts and communication doesn't go well, then it gets very frustrating. Good thing is I and pairing partner want to get our challenge done. We stay focused extra hour and eventually get our things done. It is very rewarding and gives a good feeling. <br /><br />

		  	After pairing there is feedback time. I learn from pairing session and I get a time to organize what I learned when writing feedback. Some partners are great. Someone is logigal and technically advanced than me. Someone communicates really well and make the session comfortable. Someone who doesn't have this quality they have something I can learn. I recall myself what I did bad at pairing session and how that would affect pairing. This would improve my pairing skill.<br /><br />

		  	The feedback I received was kind and I found few feedback is very helpful. Technical feedback is very clear and specific. It lets me know where I am and provides where I can find document.<br />
		  	Feedback for communication skill is more difficult to give and take. Few good ones totally convinced me and they are specific. I realized how I did and I can try to change next pairing. I need to write more specific feedback for others. <br />
