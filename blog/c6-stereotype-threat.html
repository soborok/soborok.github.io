			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
		  	<p class="date">

		  	<h5><!-- insert sub/paragraph title --></h5> 
		  	<p>It was interseting to realize how stereotype affects people becasue I have stereotypes of people and myself.<br />
		  	I remember when I had stereotype threat. When I had it I felt reluctant and discouraged. I made excuses for my low performace from stereotype and I didn't seriously try to challenge it. My behavior was not wise.<br /><br />
		  	One of my stereotype treats is girls get lower grade when they graduate from high school. Letting this get in my mind is interesting cause I was one of the girls who loves math and has beaten boys. But when I entered highschool I let some rumor get in my head. <br />
		  	I went to kind of preppy highschool in my small town. My school is one of the top highshool and actually we have beaten all other schools with highest entrance exam score. And it was a girls highschool and going to the school means you are smart and you have above average grade. I think all of my shcool girls had some kind of pride and confidence. <br />
		  	However, we started our highschool with some unproven gossip which is my school gets the highest grade when entering but lower grade when graduating. We didn't know who started the story and whether it was true or not. But absolutel that would be a good excuse for our future performance if we wouldn't do well. I and my girl friends talked about it and laughed at it. At the same time, I think I and my friends thought that story could be true. Well, my defense is I had girl identity and I lived in the society with many girls and boys and man and woman stuff. And the rumor had been good excuse for my low scoring test during my highschool life.<br /><br />
		  	According Dr. Steele's study, people performed better when stereotype threat doesn't affect them. What I am trying to do is to be aware of stereotype threat in my environment. I think this happens secretly and people let it take over them. When I run into this again I would point that out. Dr. Steele's research and my personal experience can be good grounds when I need to talk other people. I found I and my friends need to hear "You can do this.". Making stereotype threat free is importanct as well as well giving effective feedback. I will give concrete example and say "I believe you can do this." to me and my friends.
