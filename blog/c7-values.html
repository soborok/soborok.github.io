			<h3>My Values</h3>
		  	<p class="date">
		  		November 23, 2014
		  	</p>
		  	<h5>Having values in life</h5> 
		  	<p>When I think of the times in my life where Iâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, some values come to mind. They are accomplishment, friendship, honesty and independence. In general, I try to live up to these values, somehow my past several years went to the direction without few of the values. It is bit shocking and funny to find out I had a long and unhappy years. I feel bad but I should think it over and regret. What I should do is to remember my values and try to live up to them. <br />
		  	<br />
		  	<!-- Realtionship is not the values of my happiest time, but recently one of my friends asked for my advice of her relationship. She hasn't been a relationship a ong time, really really long time, and finally she got to know someone she can really like. I'v never seen her be into man before And I could feel the emotion when you start liking someone. Yes, it was exciting and I wanted to celebrate. Few days after we talked, she took an action (yes, she is brave.). It didn't work out well but she didn't seem to regret. I wish she did it better but she deserves applause. -->
		  	My challenge at DBC will be to have accomplishment. Now I am in phase 0 and I am not happy with my output. I want to code better and know more. I started this program with stereotype threat, but I am trying to let this get on my head. When I am at DBC I will need more exercise than this. I need to have actual accoplishment on anything, small thing. This will encourage me when I feel down at DBC. I think collecting/writing code examples would help me. It will be a good study material and show me where I am. Along with that honest and helpful feedback would help me. With them I can find out my way to attain my value in my time.
