			<h3>Conflict</h3>

		  	<h5>Emotional Conflict</h5> 
		  	<p>I had few conflicts in the past. Most of them had something in common. The first thing is they already had trouble with somebody else. They wanted to do it in their way, they thought they were superior than others, and they listened to only their boss. <br />
		  	YES, I was at the west end of the Compass of Shame. Let me finish attacking them. I caught them being rude to others too. I watched and heard<br />
		  	"That's not what I learned (in graduate school)."<br />
		  	"Let's do this way. (So that I can get the easiest one)"<br />
		  	"......" (giving no conversation but giving cold shoulder and bumping into sholders)<br />
		  	These happened in my 20's not 10's. I avoided these conflicts at first. There were few reasons I did that. First of all, I thought I was possibly being sensitive. Some girls would have the pressure 'Women are sensitive and emotional' in the society and don't want to gain the reputation for themselves. Another reason is I tohught that was one-time incident. Another reason is I didn't want to create drama at work. As long as I let it go (which I thought one-time happening) and I shut my mouth, I thought everything would be fine. But it wasn't. <br />
		  	<br />
		  	The other thing in common of my conflict is that it involved me. If I acted differently the situation would have been different and I would have been less stressed. Or, if it wasn't that me it would have been different. <br />
		  	I tried to avoid the conflict but eventually I expressed when it happened 2, 3 times. It didn't get better. If I could go back I'd like to do something differently. But I don't know what I can do in short term. The guys listened to the bosses so I could work hard to get promoted before them. Still I would have the conflict.<br />
		  	And my mind says using power to solve the conflict is comfortable and irght. I want to find real solution cause this conflict could happen in the future. One thing I am sure I will try to do is "be myself" and "express" at first place. I won't try to avoid the conflict. I won't try to be a nice person.
