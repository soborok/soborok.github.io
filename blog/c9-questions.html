			<h3>Good Question</h3>
		  	<p class="date">

		  	<h5>     </h5> 
		  	<p>Asking a good question is a good start of conversation and getting right solution. When people need a little piece of information, question could be simple and straightforward. And answer can be also simple and provided right away. But when the problem is compliacted and requires deeper understanding making a question is difficult. <br>
		  	When a question has where, what and how information, it is easier to answer because question indicates the object and provides specific environment. <br>
		  	There are several things to consider to make a good question. I think one of things for asking an good question is not to think listener would know everything about my problem. I think this mistake is easily made and I experienced this as a questioner and answerer. While having a conversation I and my partner realized we were missing few things. Even we were working as a same role, each project could have different environment settings. <br>
		  	Second thing is a question need to be specific. Especially when asking online about programming, questions get to be specific. What type of data do you deal with? Object in which language are you talking about? Which brower are you testing? Answer would be different according to this specific settings. However, it doesn't mean to give a lot of information. Sometimes sharing too much information interrupt communication. <br>
		  	Lastly good title is important. Good title is essential when writing email as well. This is because title is the first thing other people see and it summarize what you are saying.
