Version Control and git

How to control versions with git

October 12, 2014

For some people Version Control sounds difficult. It sounds bit fancy for me. When I think of it with programming it sounds more difficult.

But I found we do version control a lot in our life not only at work but also at home. I happened to write some instructions at work, sometimes I modified the instruction following my personal preferneces. Later I changed my mind and went back to old ones. And Sometimes I had to edit because process changed. I kept the original with little comment to the file name. I can say I was doing version control even it was not neat and fancy. 

I think it applies to cooking recipe too. Let's think you have your family pasta recipe from grandma. Your mom added some spices to the original one. You replace past to whole grain pasta. Would you want to know orginal recipe? Would you love mom's recipe better than grandma's? 

How would you keep all three versions and create the best recipe? You can have a paper for each recipe or you can have one page with crossouts and add-ons. Bring this idea to programming. git orgarnizes the versions, tracks changes and allows master to apply the changes to the recipe. 

git knows who users are and what they changed. GitHub enables the source remotely and locally for multiple peope to access. You can work on your version(repository) and apply the changes to master repository (with permission). Isn't it cool? You can preserve original recipe but you can also make changes and improve the recipe. This is what git does for your code instead of pasta recipe.
