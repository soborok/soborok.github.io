			<h3>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h3>
		  	<p class="date">October 19, 2014</p>
		  	<h5>Eggs in crate</h5> 
		  	<p>Margin is the space between the element and other element. <br />
		  	Border is the surrounding line of the element. <br />
		  	Padding is the space between the element content and its border.<br /><br />

		  	Imagine you are a yolk surrounded by egg white and covered with egg shell.<br />
		  	Egg shell is the border between you and outside world. <br />
		  	Egg white surrounds yolk with white soft padding.<br />
		  	And the yolk is the content which is most nutritious and you want to show off the most. <br />
		  	Uhoh wait. There are more eggs. They are on your right and left, front and back. They have some distance with you. That is margin. <br />
