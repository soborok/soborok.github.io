			<h3>Variable Scope</h3>
		  	<p class="date">
		  		November 14, 2014 
		  	</p>
		  	<h5>variables - local, instance, class and global</h5> 
		  	<p>To know variable scope of Ruby, I need to see how a class looks like.<br>
		  	A class is defined starting with 'class' keyword and terminatined by 'end' keyword. Inside the difinition, it has methods, variables and calls. I can imagine what different types of variables exists by looking at they are placed in class definition.<br>
		  	<br>
		  	Let's get familiar how they are written. <br>
		  	<br>
		  	local_variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always found in my code and it works in the method<br>
		  	@instance_variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen in initialize method of a class <br>
		  	<!-- Add later: class instance variable -->
		  	@@class_variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need double consideration to use this class variable<br>
		  	$global_variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looks global cause it has $ sign!<br>
		  	<br>
		  	Local variable works where it is defined. It cannot be accessed from another class or method. When the mothod is ovr the local variable is no longer alive. <br>
		  	<br>
		  	Instance variable is available for instances of a class. I'd like to say intance variable is owned by an instance. This mean each instance will have the same name instance variable but each stores different value. <br>
		  	<br>
		  	<!-- Add later: class instance variable -->
		  	Class variable is available across instances. This means the class variable can be accessed by instance A and instance B. When instance A changes the class variable, instance B will have the changed class variable. <br>
		  	<br>
		  	Global variable is available accross classes. It can be accessed out of the method or class.<br>
		  	<br>
		  	Let's see an example.<br>
		  	</p>
		  	<p class="rubyfile">
			class Student<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;@@number_of_students = 0<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(input_name, input_city)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@name = input_name<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@city = input_city<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@number_of_students += 1<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;def number_of_students<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@number_of_students<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;def display<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"#{@name} is from #{@city} and attending #{$location} cohort."<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
			end<br>
			<br>
			$location = "San Francisco"<br>
			<br>
			student_jen = Student.new("Jen<br>Chicago")<br>
			puts student_jen.number_of_students<br>
			puts student_jen.display<br>
			<br>
			student_andrew = Student.new("Andrew<br>New York")<br>
			puts student_andrew.number_of_students<br>
			puts student_andrew.display<br>
			<br>
			puts student_jen.number_of_students<br>
		  	</p>
		  	<p>The output will be</p>
		  	<p class="rubyfile">
			1<br>
			Jen is from Chicago and attending San Francisco cohort.<br>
			2<br>
			Andrew is from New York and attending San Francisco cohort.<br>
			2<br>
			</p>
			<p>
		  	$location is a global variable. It is used in display method of Student. But it wasn't passed into the methode unlikely other variables. <br>
		  	<br>
		  	@@number_of_students is a class variable of class "Student". An instance of "Student" class can access @@number_of_students. When student_jen instance was created @@number_of_students increased by 1 and student_jen printed it out. When student_andrew instance was created @@number_of_students increased by 1 again and now @@number_of_students is 2. student_jen and student_andrew printed out the same number which is "2".<br>
		  	<br>
		  	@name and @city are instance variables of "Student" class. student_jen has @name and @city. student_andrew has @name and @city, too. Instance variable names are the same as @name and @city but they store different values. This is because each instance owns the instance variables.<br>
		  	<br>
		  	input_name and input_city are locali variables in initialize method. They store the values pass the values into instance variables which are @name and @city. input_name and input_city cannot be accessed in another method.<br>
		  	<br>
		  	You wouldn't want every object to access every variable and mess up with them. You don't want Andrew to change Jen's name. <br>
		  	You would want to access a variable where you need it. Jen wants to know how many student is attending San Francisco cohort. <br>
		  	You wouldn't want variables to take memory unnecessarily for all methods. input_name and input_city are stored in instance variables. They don't need to be available for display or other methods.<br>
		  	<br>
		  	I drew a simple chart; global > class > instance > local<br>
		  	It may change when I gain deeper understanding of variables of Ruby, for now, I see where I would want to use a variable.
