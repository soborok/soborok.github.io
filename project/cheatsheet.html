		<header><h2>IDE for Web Programming</h2></header> 
		<p>An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment. an IDE allows developers to work on code and test out, review, and debug that code. When working on our challenges, our go-to space has been working with our Editor (sublime) and the terminal (using IRB or Node) but an IDE let's you utilize both of these platforms in one place. Here's a set of resources you can use to test out your code in each of the languages we used in Phase 0.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.tryruby.org" target="new">Try Ruby</a></li>
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font> it's pretty, and simple, it's also built into a site that helps you learn ruby, so if you are struggling, you can always use the lessons! <br />
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> it's not built to let you edit your code AND run it, so you'll have problems using this for large sets of code.<br />
					<br />
					<img src="./imgs/tryruby.png" width="600">
				<li><a href="http://labs.codecademy.com/#:workspace" target="new">Codeacademy Labs</a></li>
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font>  this is an editor, console space with examples for you to use and a simple clean workspace to try out your code.<br /> 
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> this site uses an old version of RUBY docs, so some of your code might not work.<br />
					<br />
					<img src="./imgs/CodeAcademy-workspace.png" width="600">
				<li>IRB in your terminal, using your editor</li>
					Type 'irb' in terminal. <br />
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font> it returns instant result to code. 
				<li><a href="http://repl.it/" target="new">repl.it</a></li>
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font> very much built like the Codeacademy Labs, this space lets you run code on lots of languages, not just ruby! you can save the copy of all your code in the editor and console history for your record. <br />
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> in the same vein as the codeacademy labs, this is running an old version of Ruby.<br />

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" target="new">JSFiddle</a></li>
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font> This space is very commonly used to show code in StackOverflow, and has nice collab features, as well as tidy-up and JSHint, which will help you have clean and working code. It's a great place to test out JS code that works with HTML and CSS code. <br />
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> it does not have a console window so you wont be able to see anything that prints to console.log. <br />
					<br />
					<img src="./imgs/JSfiddle.png" width="650">
				<li><a href="http://jsbin.com/" target="new">JS bin</a></li>
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font>  in addition to HTML, CSS and JS window there is a console window to see everything going on in your code.<br />
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> there's no line count, so the errors will not be easy to find. the share function doesnt really help you collaborate on your code.<br />
					<br />
					<img src="./imgs/JSbin.png" width="600">
				<li>Javascript console in browser</li>
				<li>node</li>
					Type 'node' in terminal. <br />
					<font color="#00628B">pros</font> it returns instant result. <br />
					<font color="#00628B">cons</font> some code doesn't work like 'prompt'.
